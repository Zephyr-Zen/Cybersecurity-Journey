*Last updated: 21/10/2025*

## A
- **Access Controls:** Measures such as passwords and group policies that only allow authorised people to access data.
- **Audit Trails:** A record of all the changes made to data including the time is was changed and who by.
- **ARP (Address Resolution Protocol):** The technology that allows devices to identify themselves on a network by sending ARP Requests for a MAC address belonging to a certain IP address and an ARP reply containing the MAC address if a devices IP address matches the request. The device then saves the IP and MAC addresses to its ARP Cache.
- **Availability:** Ensuring data is able to be accessed when required and for whatever duration required.
## B
- **Blue Team:** A person(s) responsible for defending a network or system from attacks.
## C
- **Checksums:** A mathematical algorithm that generates unique values for data sets. When the data changes so will the value, indicating there's been an alteration.
- **CIA Triad:** The model within cybersecurity consisting of Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability.
- **Confidentiality:** Keeping data secret or private, with only authorised people being able to access it.
## D
- **DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing):** A form of vulnerability scan that looks for weaknesses to exploit in a running application.
- **Default Gateway:** The address assigned to the device on the network that is capable of sending information to other networks, usually a router.
- **DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol):** The protocol used to automatically assign IP addresses to devices on a network. DHCP Discover > DHCP Offer > DHCP Request > DHCP ACK.
- **Digital Security:** Protecting data and systems from digital threats such as hackers or malware.
## E
- **Encryption:** Transform data into an unreadable form, that can only be transformed back by the correct decryption key.
- **Ethical Hacker:** A hacker who works with clients/companies by hacking their systems in order to test and better them in order to be more resilient to the real deal.
## F

## G

## H
- **Hacktivist:** Hacker + activist - People who use hacking as a means of seeking political or economic change.
- **Host Address:** The ending portion of an IP Address that identifies the devices location on the network i.e 192.168.1.*0* .
- **Human Security:** Protecting data against threats caused by human behaviour - such as leaking data or poor password practices.
## I
- **ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol):** A network layer protocol used by network devices to communicate errors and operational information. Used with tools such as ping and traceroute.
- **Integrity:** The data is accurate and trustworthy, free from any unwanted modifications.
- **IP (Internet Protocol) Address:** A set of numbers that represent a devices location on a network.
## J

## K

## L
- **Likelihood:** The chance of a risk occuring. One equation is Adversary Capability * Adversary Motivation * Vulnerability Severity.
## M
- **MAC (Media Access Control) Address:** A unique identifier for the physical device, found on the the Network Interface Card (NIC).
- **Malicious Insider:** Someone within an organisation/with authorised access to a resource that intends to harm that organisation/resource.
## N
- **Nation-state Hacker:** Hackers who seek to provide a strategic advantage to their country through methods such as reconnaissance or information manipulation.
- **Network Address:** The starting portion of an IP Address that identifies the network i.e *192.168.1*.0 .
## O
- **OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Model:** A model depicting how all networked devices send, receive and interpret data. Physical > Data Link > Network > Transport > Session > Presentation > Application.
- **OSPF (Open Shortest Path First):** A protocol to used to determine where to send data at the network layer of the OSI by selecting the path with the least devices to transverse.
## P
- **Physical Security:** Protecting physical devices and other tangible assests from physical threats such as theft or natural disasters.
## Q

## R
- **Red Team:** A person(s) that looks for vulnerabilities in systems by emulating an attacker or malicious actor.
- **Risk Appetite:** Indicates the level of risk willing to be accepted with high being willing to accept more risk and low less risk.
- **Risk Response:** They way in which a risk is responded to: Acceptance, Reduction, Transference and Rejection.
- **Risk Value:** Consequence * Likelihood. A high risk value indicates a risk is likely to occur and will have a huge impact on the system.
## S
- **SAST (Static Application Security Testing):** A form of vulnerability scan that scans an applications code while it isn't running.
- **Script Kiddie:** Usually a novice hacker, who uses tools/software developed by more capable hackers.
- **Secrets Detection:** Scanning for sensitive credentials in code of files that the developer may have accidentally left in, such as passwords and encryption keys.
- **SIEM (Security Information and Event Management):** Software and processes that collect and analyse log and event data within an organisation to identify suspicious activity and generate alerts.
- **SOC (Security Operations Centre):** A centralised unit responsible for managing and responding to cybersecurity threats.
- **Subnetting:** Splitting up a network into smaller networks.
## T
- **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol):** A protocol at the transport layer of the OSI model that forms a constant connection between two devices for the duration it takes for the data to be sent/recieved. It checks the data to make sure it's all been recieved and is assembled in the correct order.
- **Threat Modeling:** A process in which threats to account for in software development/support are identified and categorised. 
## U
- **User Datagram Protocol:** A protocol at the transport layer of the OSI model that sends data but does not check if it's recieved by the target device.
- **Unit Tests:** Tests that are conducted on single components of an application to ensure they are working correctly and can include security checks.
## V
- **Vulnerability Scan:** Identify weaknesses within an application and it's resources such as the libraries it uses.
