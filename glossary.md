- **DMZ (Demilitarised Zone):** A network segment that acts as a buffer by sitting between an organisations private network and the internet.
- **DNS (Domain Name System)**: The protocol that resolves domain names in to IP addresses.
- **DoS (Denial-of-Service) attack:** An attack which disrupts a part of or complete system, causing an outage.
## E
- **Encryption:** Transform data into an unreadable form, that can only be transformed back by the correct decryption key.
- **Ethical Hacker:** A hacker who works with clients/companies by hacking their systems in order to test and better them in order to be more resilient to the real deal.
## F

## G

- **Human Security:** Protecting data against threats caused by human behaviour - such as leaking data or poor password practices.
## I

## M
- **MAC (Media Access Control) Address:** A unique identifier for the physical device, found on the the Network Interface Card (NIC).
- **Malicious Insider:** Someone within an organisation/with authorised access to a resource that intends to harm that organisation/resource.
- **Malware:** All types of malicious/harmful software.
- **MitM (Man-in-the-Middle) attack:** An attack where hackers insert themselves between a client and server, allowing them to listen in on communication or redirect the victim to fake sites.
- **MITRE ATT&CK (Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge) Matrix:** A table of information created by MITRE based on tatics cyberattackers used, in order to help examine cyberattacks.
## N
- **Nation-state Hacker:** Hackers who seek to provide a strategic advantage to their country through methods such as reconnaissance or information manipulation.
- **Network Address:** The starting portion of an IP Address that identifies the network i.e *192.168.1*.0 .
## O
- **OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Model:** A model depicting how all networked devices send, receive and interpret data. Physical > Data Link > Network > Transport > Session > Presentation > Application.
- **OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence):** Intelligence acquired from publicly available sources and websites.
- **OSPF (Open Shortest Path First):** A protocol to used to determine where to send data at the network layer of the OSI by selecting the path with the least devices to transverse.
## 
- **Patch Management:** Part of software vulnerability management where systems are updated and patches are applied to fix problems when available.
- **Phishing:** Sending messages to trick people into performing specific actions.
- **Physical Security:** Protecting physical devices and other tangible assests from physical threats such as theft or natural disasters.
## Q

## R
- **Red Team:** A person(s) that looks for vulnerabilities in systems by emulating an attacker or malicious actor.
- **Risk Appetite:** Indicates the level of risk willing to be accepted with high being willing to accept more risk and low less risk.
- **Risk Response:** They way in which a risk is responded to: Acceptance, Reduction, Transference and Rejection.
- **Risk Value:** Consequence * Likelihood. A high risk value indicates a risk is likely to occur and will have a huge impact on the system.
## S
- **SAST (Static Application Security Testing):** A form of vulnerability scan that scans an applications code while it isn't running.
- **Script Kiddie:** Usually a novice hacker, who uses tools/software developed by more capable hackers.

- **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol):** A protocol at the transport layer of the OSI model that forms a constant connection between two devices for the duration it takes for the data to be sent/recieved. It checks the data to make sure it's all been recieved and is assembled in the correct order.
- **Threat Modeling:** A process in which threats to account for in software development/support are identified and categorised. 
## U
- **User Datagram Protocol:** A protocol at the transport layer of the OSI model that sends data but does not check if it's recieved by the target device.
